# WS2812 NeoPixel Library
RP2040 library for controlling strips/pixels using WS2812 (NeoPixel) LEDs using PIO and pico-sdk

I wanted a library for use with the WS2812 (NeoPixel) on the RP2040 that didn't rely on Arduino.h or any other AVR include file.  So I created this library using the pico-examples, the Adafruit NeoPixel library and some other RP2040 sources as reference.
